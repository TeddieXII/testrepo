UNIVERSITY OF MAURITIUS SDGs Newsletter
According to the United Nations, about 14 % of food produced is
lost between harvest and retail and about 17 % is wasted and this
accounts for about 3.3 gigatonnes of greenhouse gas emissions.
Sustainable Development Goal 12.3 calls for the world to reduce
per capita food waste by 50 % at the retail and consumer levels and
reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including
post-harvest losses. Reducing food waste/loss will not only boost
food security and improve livelihoods, but it will also entail reduc-
tion of greenhouse gas emissions, protection of our planet’s biodi-
versity for future generations and saving of limited resources like
land, energy, labor and water. Thus SDG12.3 is both a goal in itself
but also a means to achieve other SDGS as illustrated in Figure 1.
Mauritius , a small island developing state (SIDS), being a UN mem-
ber, is called upon to implement the SDGs. Food losses, especially
postharvest losses, occur along the food chain while food waste oc-
curs at the hospitality sector, food service sector and household lev-
els. The Faculty of Agriculture of the University of Mauritius played a
leading role in creating awareness through the Food loss and Food
Waste reduction initiative (February 2018 to June 2019). A team of
academics (Assoc Prof D.Goburdhun, Assoc Prof A Ruggoo, Dr D
Ramful Baboolall and Dr R Brizmohun Gopaul ) is now involved in an
EU funded project DeSIRA (Development Smart Innovation through
Research in Agriculture) and the Work Package 3 focusses on food
waste valorisation and nationwide sensitization on food loss and
food waste reduction. With the collaboration of 14 contributors, the
team developed a recipe book entitled “Valorising food leftovers
and ugly fruits and vegetables”. It was launched by the first Counsel-
or of the Delegation of the European Union to the Republic of Mau-
ritius in the presence of the Acting President of the Republic of Mau-
ritius and the Vice Chancellor on the 29th September 2023, which
marks the International Day of Awareness of Food Loss and Waste
(Figure 2).

Thirty five workshops dealing with different facets of food loss/
waste, have been organized, along with awareness campaigns on
media around the island. It is estimated that about 25,000 peo-
ple have been reached. The Faculty has been working closely with
the stakeholders including school children, both from Mauritius
and Rodrigues, and the civil society. The workshops and talks were
very inclusive, targeting a high proportion of women, people of
different ages and of different educational levels.
SDGS addressed: SDG 12.3 mainly and SDGS 1,2,9,10,11,13,14 and 15.
